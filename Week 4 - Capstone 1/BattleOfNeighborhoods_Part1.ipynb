    "\n",
    "The ultimate aim and indeed measure of usefulness of this study is to help law enforcement to focus on particular crime types and be able to apply resources more efficiently to a particular area. To keep the size of this study manageable only the following questions will be investigated.\n",

For the 2 area in consideration, Reading and Oxford, we shall center on the main shopping/retail/late night entertainment region of each.\n",
    "\n",
    "A neighborhood will contain areas with differing crime levels. High crime is typically not spread over an area but will be concentrated into so called 'hot-spots'. If we can identify these hot-spots then we can look into whether the kinds of venues in the vicinity of that hot-spot such as shops, bars, cinemas etc indicate a likelihood of crime occurring there in future."
